**WHITE PAPER:**(https://e-talk.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/E-TALKWhite-paper.pdf )


## (1) ikọbọ is a open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, powering E-TALK. 
ikọbọ is the crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. ikọbọ is the native cryptocurrency used in E-TALK ecosystem and E-TALK online shop. ikọbọ (ETK) is a decentralized network that allows anyone to request a payment or pay for goods and services and also Request Invoice for which the recipient can pay in a secure way. All of the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. This results in cheaper, easier, and more secure payments, and it allows for a wide range of automation possibilities.
To become the backbone of world trade, ikọbọ integrates a general ledger (in the accounting sense of the term), which is:
- Universal because it is designed to support 100% of global transactions, regardless of currency, legislation or language. ikọbọ is built to last.
- Smart because unlike an existing standard accounting book, ikọbọ is at the origin of the exchanges and integrates a computerized trade code, as well as the management of a multitude of payment terms.
Today, their absence makes the whole system inefficient and absolutely unready for the digital and IoT (Internet Of Things) revolution that is taking place.
ikọbọ can be seen as a layer on top of Ethereum, which allows requests for payments for goods and services that satisfy a legal framework.It is also possible to see currencies as tools to complete ETK transactions. In this sense, ETK is more global than any currency.
